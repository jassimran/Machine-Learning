# Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Processess

Application of some of the techniques learned from reinforcement learning for making decisions.

Analyzed two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and solved each MDP using value iteration as well as policy iteration. Then used reinforcement learning algorithm (I chose Q-learning) to solve the two MDPs and analyzed the difference in performance among the two.

### Tools Used
I used [Burlap](http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/) for my analysis because it had everything that I was looking for. It had excellent tutorial using which I experimented with a lot of different MDPs before choosing the problems. I also used the code provided by juanjose49 on github and modified it as per my problems and cutsomize the code further as per my needs. Most of my graphs have been plotted using Plotly.
